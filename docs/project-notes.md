# Project Notes

This document records early project context from May 2026, when AudioInputLocker
was moved into its current repository.

For current input-priority behavior and source boundaries, see [Input Priority](input-priority.md).

## Project

AudioInputLocker is a macOS menu bar app for managing the system default audio
input device. The original motivation was simple: macOS already exposes a
native-looking Sound output menu, but not a matching input-device menu. This app
fills that gap with a Sound-style menu focused on input devices.

The app is currently implemented as a SwiftUI macOS menu bar app:

- `MenuBarExtra` with custom template menu bar icons for normal and locked
  states.
- Dock icon hidden through `LSUIElement = true`
- Core Audio is used for device enumeration, default input switching, input
  volume reading/writing, and device-change monitoring.
- The project targets macOS 13+, while the HUD uses macOS 26 glass APIs when
  available.

## Main Files

- `AudioInputLocker/AudioInputLockerApp.swift`: app entry point and menu bar extra.
- `AudioInputLocker/SoundMenuView.swift`: Sound-style popover UI.
- `AudioInputLocker/AudioInputViewModel.swift`: state management, lock behavior,
  Core Audio orchestration, and the transient HUD implementation.
- `AudioInputLocker/CoreAudioInputManager.swift`: Core Audio wrapper.
- `AudioInputLocker/InputDevice.swift`: device model and display metadata.
- `scripts/build-and-run.sh`: local build/restart helper.
- `docs/liquid-glass-investigation.md`: investigation notes about Liquid Glass
  public APIs and experiments.

## Current Behavior

The menu lists available input devices and lets the user switch the system
default input device. It includes:

- Input volume slider.
- Input device list.
- Lock Input Device section.
- Sound Settings entry.

The lock feature is the main product behavior:

- When locking is enabled, a device can be locked as the preferred input device.
- External input changes, such as AirPods auto-switching, System Settings
  changes, or command-line changes, are detected through Core Audio and switched
  back to the locked device when it is online.
- App-internal manual switching creates a short grace state instead of
  immediately overriding the user's choice.
- Locked/offline devices remain visible in the lock section so the user's
  intent is preserved across unplugging, reconnecting, and app restarts.

The lock state is persisted in `UserDefaults`.

## HUD

The app shows a transient native-style HUD when it switches input back to the
locked device. The HUD is intentionally similar to the macOS AirPods route HUD:

- Liquid Glass-style rounded capsule.
- Left product-like microphone glyph.
- Center text with marquee behavior for long device names.
- Right circular lock/unlock action button.
- Hover keeps the HUD visible.
- Hover reveals a close button near the upper-left outer edge.
- The HUD supports lock and unlock actions directly.

Important HUD implementation details:

- The HUD window uses `.statusBar` level. A previous `.floating` experiment made
  the whole canvas get constrained below the menu bar, which caused the capsule
  to appear too low.
- The current debug-sampled raw window Y target is `2`.
- The HUD window has a larger transparent canvas than the visible capsule to
  allow natural shadows without clipping.
- Mouse handling uses dynamic `ignoresMouseEvents` so transparent canvas areas
  do not block menu bar clicks.
- When the menu opens, the HUD is dismissed.

## Visual Direction

The menu UI was iteratively aligned against native macOS Sound output UI:

- Native popover rhythm, dividers, row hover, and icon circles.
- Device rows are aligned with the `Input` title and `Sound Settings...`.
- Unselected icon circles and hover colors are close to the native menu.
- Output-only blocks such as Listening Mode, Spatial Audio, and Conversation
  Awareness are intentionally omitted.

The app uses native/default styling where possible, then small targeted
adjustments where screenshots showed a clear mismatch.

## Icon Mapping

The menu device-list icons use a device-to-SF-Symbol mapping informed by
Core Audio device metadata and open-source reference research. The HUD uses the
`AudioInputLocker/HUDMicrophone.png` asset instead of the device icon mapping.

## Liquid Glass Notes

Several experiments were made to match macOS 26's more aggressive AirPods HUD
glass style. Public API investigation found:

- `Glass.regular`, `.clear`, `.identity`
- `tint()`
- `interactive()`
- `glassEffect(_:in:)`
- `GlassEffectContainer`

The current implementation uses the best public-API approximation found during
the experiments. It does not rely on private APIs.

## Build And Run

Use:

```sh
./scripts/build-and-run.sh
```

The script builds the Debug app, kills a running `AudioInputLocker` process if
present, then launches the freshly built app.

A successful verification at the time of this init produced:

```text
BUILD SUCCEEDED
```

## Git Init Notes

This repository should track source, project files, docs, and scripts. It should
not track:

- `build/`
- `DerivedData/`
- Xcode user state
- `.DS_Store`
- local `.claude/` settings

## Known Follow-Up Areas

- Continue small HUD visual tuning against real screenshots.
- Consider splitting `AudioInputViewModel.swift`, which currently owns too much:
  view model state, Core Audio coordination, lock state machine, and HUD UI.
- Keep validating the lock state machine with AirPods auto-switching and USB
  mic reconnect scenarios.
